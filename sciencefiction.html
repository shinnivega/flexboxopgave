            <h1>Science Fiction</h1>
            <p>Science fiction film is a film genre that uses science fiction: speculative, science-based
                depictions of phenomena that are not necessarily accepted by mainstream science, such as
                extraterrestrial life forms, alien worlds, extrasensory perception, and time travel, often
                along with futuristic elements such as spacecraft, robots, or other technologies. Science
                fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore
                philosophical issues like the human condition. In many cases, tropes derived from written
                science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards
                of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held.
                The genre has existed since the early years of silent cinema, when Georges Melies&#39; A Trip to
                the Moon (1902) amazed audiences with its trick photography effects. The next major
                example in the genre was the 1927 film Metropolis. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the genre
                consisted mainly of low-budget B-movies. After Stanley Kubrick&#39;s 1968 landmark 2001: A
                Space Odyssey, the science fiction film genre was taken more seriously. In the late 1970s,
                big-budget science fiction films filled with special effects became popular with audiences
                after the success of Star Wars and paved the way for the blockbuster hits of subsequent
                decades.</p>
